## Programming: 10 Hackerrank Challenges
I found this task really tough as I had very little knowledge of competitive programming and I did poorly. 
I attempted every challenge but could get score of 100 in only 4(Good Strings, Ryuk and His Death Notes, The D, Jack Jack Codes). 

I had very basic knowledge of C++ and attempted all challeges using that language. I had no idea about vectors or lists or sorting but I  learned about them (to make my code more efficient) from [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) or [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) . 

In conclusion, I have to work hard on my Competitive Programming and Problem solving skills.
