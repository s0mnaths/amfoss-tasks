## Spammer Spaghetti
When I read about task-09, to use JavaScript to spam messages in Telegram, I looked up for more resources about it, and found out it pretty simple and also found a script on github that worked perfectly. So [vchrombie](https://github.com/vchrombie) instructed me to write script for a **WhatsApp Spammer** instead.
There were lots Whatsapp spammer scripts already on github and elsewhere, but surprisingly none of them worked. But I tried to understand as much as I could from each of them and learn basics of JS and HTML DOM to complete this task.


**NOTE**: In the script we can either use *setInterval* or *for loop* for iterating the message (see the comments in [whatsapp_spammer.js](https://github.com/s0mnaths/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-09/whatsapp_spammer.js)). When using *setInterval*, the user can set the interval between each message, whereas in *for loop*, all messages will be sent at once!

Just edit the value of *variable message* and *counter*, and after opening a chat in Whatsapp Web, run this on the console!
