## Spammer_Spaghetti
When I read about task-09, to use JavaScript to spam messages in Telegram, I looked up more info about it and found out it was pretty simple and also found a script on github that worked perfectly. So [vchrombie](https://github.com/vchrombie) instructed me to make a WhatsApp spammer instead.
There were lots whatsapp spammers already on github and elsewhere, but surprisingly none of them worked. But I tried to understand as much as I could from each of them and learn about JS and HTML DOM to complete this task.

Just edit the value of variable message and counter, and after opening a chat in Whatsapp Web, run this on the console!
