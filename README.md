## About my Tasks
When I had started doing the tasks, I didn't think I could complete even one-third of them. But each task got me so interested and also so annoyed(when I couldn't figure out my errors) that I would keep thinking about them over and over during the slow online classes, or stay awake late at night figuring out how to overcome them, that when I would finally complete a task, it would only motivate me and fill me with confidence to try the next one. Thanks to my mentors and other amFOSS members, I was able to complete most of them.
I will still try to complete the remaining ones (especially Rustic Scraper) because the **Learning Never Stops!**

## About me
I’m Somnath Sharma, born and brought up in small a city called Bhilai in Chhattisgarh. I've always had an interest in computers(like any other kid my age) but my real interest in programming started in Grade-10th when I had started learning Javascript as a hobby. This made me choose Computer Science as a subject in my Higher Secondary, which proved helpful in doing these tasks. 
I joined ASE, Amritapuri because I had heard about its great coding culture and the FOSS and ethical hacking clubs. Even though I couldn't get into the branch of my choice, I'm a strong believer of *“Schooling doesn't assure employment but Skill does.”* and I'm sure that with enough consistency in my work and motivation from my Seniors, everything will work out fine! After doing these tasks, my passion for CS has been rekindled (after a long break due to JEE preparation), and amFOSS seems like the perfect place where I could spend my time after classes, learning new things, or scratching my head over trying to do an Open Source project.
