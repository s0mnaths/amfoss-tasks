After doing task-08, I had confidence in myself and I decided to attempt this task. The [Go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) repository was really helpful and with it's examples I figured out how to search,display posts and upvote them!

Initally I was having errors with my credentials but when i get that sorted out, and the posts got upvoted and got really excited. Also this task took the least ammount of time I think(apart from task-0,1,2)
