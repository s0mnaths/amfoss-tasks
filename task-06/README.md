## Geddit
After doing task-08, I had confidence in myself and I decided to attempt this task. The [Go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) repository was really helpful and I used this library for calling the Reddit API.

Initally I was having errors with my credentials but when I got that sorted out. I put the code to upvote posts in a loop, and it worked fine. I had also got the **Time** filter wrong initially, but then figured out what it was supposed to be. 

**Note**: 
1. Install [Go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) before running the file.
2. In place of *ID, SECRET, USERNAME, PASSWORD*, enter your own credentials
