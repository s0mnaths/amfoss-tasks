After doing task-08, I had confidence in myself and I decided to attempt this task. The [Go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) repository was really helpful and with it's examples I figured out how to search,display posts and upvote them!

Initally I was having errors with my credentials but when I got that sorted out, and the posts got upvoted I got really excited. 

**Note**: 
1. Install [Go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) before running the file.
2. In place of *ID, SECRET, USERNAME, PASSWORD*, enter your own credentials
