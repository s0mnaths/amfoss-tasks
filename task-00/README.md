## Installing Ubuntu 
I installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I dual booted my laptop with both Windows 10 Home and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on SSD. During installation I didn't face any issues but after installation I found that my keyboard was glitching(because I had chosen the wrong keyboard during installation) but I fixed it later.
