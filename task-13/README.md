## Circuit Design
Learned very basics of Arduino and what all it can do, also the langauge was pretty easy and similar to C++. Also I was familar to [Tinkerad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) as I had a Lab-session regarding it.

The circuit uses Ultrasonic Sensor, and stops the motor if any obstacle is present less than 100cm from it.

Pretty simple task, had to do it as my branch is Electronics and Computer.
