### Ubiquitous UI
Initially I was using TabBarView for getting the 2 "page views" but then I found out about PageView Class, which made things easy. I was also confused about where to put the [dotsIndicator](https://pub.dev/packages/dots_indicator) widget in the code and it was creating problems for my layout, but finally i got that right too! I hope it looks as expected.
