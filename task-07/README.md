### Ubiquitous UI
Initially I was using TabBarView for getting the 2 "page views" but then I found out about PageView Class, which made things easy. Also I was confused about where to put the [dotsIndicator](https://pub.dev/packages/dots_indicator) widget in the code and it was creating problems for my layout, but finally I got that right! I hope it looks as expected.
