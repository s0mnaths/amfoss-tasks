### Ubiquitous UI
Initially I was using *TabBarView* for getting the 2 "page views" but then I found out about *PageView Class* and *PageController*, which made things easy. Also I was confused about where to put the [dotsIndicator](https://pub.dev/packages/dots_indicator) widget in the code and it was creating problems for my layout, but finally I got that right! The official Flutter documentation and its Youtube videos really helped. I tried to make it as similar as possible to the example given in the Task Document.
Working in Flutter was fun(except for the emulator eating my RAM) and I hope it looks as expected.

**PS** The colors look a bit different in the .gif above, and the [main.dart](https://github.com/s0mnaths/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-07/lib/main.dart) file is in *lib* folder.
