# Introspection
### 1. Why must we choose you?
I'm very much interested in Coding and learning about different Programming Languages, doing Projects, and knowing more about Open Source Contributions. I'm a very keen learner and I'll try to give my best to the club. I can also be consistent for things that I have an interest in, so I'll be learning or working on something every time.
By joining amFOSS I'll be able to improve my technical and social skills and also dive deep into the crust of CS and FOSS.

### 2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next three months, I plan to learn about different programming languages, work on a project and try to explore the *World of Programming* as much as I can, so that I get an idea about everything. I'm also hoping to focus more in class so that I get a good CGPA(resulting in reduced Fees).

### 3. How would you contribute back to the club? 
I like the **CODE -> SHARE -> GROW** concept, and whatever I learn, I would be more than happy to pass on to my coming juniors who are as interested in CS & FOSS as I am, because *"The more you Teach, the more you Learn."*

### 4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process was well structured, it exposed us to different programming languages(Go, Rust, Dart, JavaScript, Python, etc.) and made us familiar with various things like Competitive coding, Problem Solving, Web Scraping, using the API, App Designing, and Arduino. Most of all, the tasks made us comfortable with using the Terminal and using Git and GitHub. I believe that enough time(40 days) was given to us for completing the tasks.
These tasks upped the level of motivation in me every time I would complete a task. The selection process looks for *dedication* and *passion* within a student to **learn to code and create** and I think that's the best way.
