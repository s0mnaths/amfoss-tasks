## Debugging Derbies
Initially after seeing the long 500 line code in the MathQuiz.java file, I got nervous but then soon after reading beginner Java documentation, I figured out that it was just basic syntax errors and I got rid of them. Then when I ran the code, the button functions were all wrong. So I interchanged the button functions with other button functions. I also had to look up a few things to get rid of all of Lenna's mistake but at the end everything was a breeze.
